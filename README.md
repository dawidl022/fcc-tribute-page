# FCC: Tribute page
First project in FreeCodeCamp Resposive Web Design course.

What I learnt:
- [Where to put `<script>` tags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/436411/where-should-i-put-script-tags-in-html-markup): In the head section BUT using the `async` attribute. The old way was to put scripts just before the closing `</body>`. Either of the 2 mentioned methods are necessary in order for the fcc test script to work, i.e. placing the script in the head section without `async` didn't work at all.

What I had difficulties with:
- Knowing what HTML5 semantic tags to use and when to use them.
- How the cascading mechanism works in CSS.
- Knowing what default CSS styles the browser had set, perhaps it's a good idea to use some basic CSS reset.
- Getting the website to display how I want it to on mobile. It seems to be different than just resising the browser on desktop.
